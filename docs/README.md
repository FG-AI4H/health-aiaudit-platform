## About us <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The [ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health](https://itu.int/go/fgai4h/), founded in 2018 by ITU-T in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), is establishing a standardized framework for the assessment of AI/ML models for health. [This repository](https://github.com/FG-AI4H/health-aiaudit-platform) contains the source code of an experimental [benchmarking platform](https://health.aiaudit.org/) (which is based on, but not affiliated to the open-source tool EvalAI).

## Features <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

We offer an environment for fully customizable machine learning benchmarks for a wide variety of medical applications.

## Demo <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

You can view our running platform [here](https://health.aiaudit.org/).
